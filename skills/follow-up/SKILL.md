# Write Follow-Up Email

Generate a follow-up email that re-engages prospects who didn't respond.

## Input

Parse $ARGUMENTS for:
- **Original email** or context of first outreach
- **Days since last email**: How long ago was it sent
- **Follow-up number**: Is this #1, #2, or #3?
- **New context** (optional): News, trigger events, new value to offer

If original context is missing, ask for the key points from the first email.

## Strategy by Follow-Up Number

### Follow-up #1 (3-5 days after)
- Assume they're busy, not uninterested
- Add new value or angle
- Keep it shorter than original

### Follow-up #2 (7-10 days after)
- Try a different approach
- Share a relevant insight or resource
- Reframe the value prop

### Follow-up #3 (14+ days after)
- "Break-up" email or permission-based close
- Give them an easy out
- Last attempt before moving on

## Frameworks

### The Bump
- Quick, friendly nudge
- "Floating this back up" energy
- Best for follow-up #1

### The Value-Add
- Share something useful (article, insight, idea)
- Shows you're thinking about their problems
- Best for follow-up #2

### The Breakup
- "Should I close your file?"
- Creates urgency without pressure
- Best for follow-up #3

## Hard Rules

1. **Shorter than original** - Each follow-up gets shorter
2. **New angle**: Don't just repeat the first email
3. **No guilt trips**: "I haven't heard back" sounds needy
4. **No "just checking in"**: Empty phrase, add value instead
5. **Reference original**: Brief callback to first email
6. **One CTA**: Same or simplified ask
7. **30-75 words max**: Follow-ups should be scannable

## What NOT to Write

- "I wanted to follow up on my last email" (weak opener)
- "I'm sure you're busy but..." (apologetic)
- Resending the exact same email
- Being passive-aggressive about no response
- Multiple CTAs or new complex asks

## Output Format

```
Subject: Re: [original subject] or [new short subject]

[Email body]

[First name]
```

**Framework used:** [which one]
**What's different:** [how this differs from original]
**Word count:** [number]
