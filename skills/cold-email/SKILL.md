# Write Cold Email

Generate a cold email that gets responses using proven copywriting frameworks.

## Input

Parse $ARGUMENTS for:
- **Target**: Who they're emailing (role, company, industry)
- **Goal**: What they want (meeting, intro, feedback, sale)
- **Context**: Personalization hooks (mutual connection, recent news, specific pain point)

If arguments are incomplete, ask for the missing pieces.

## Frameworks (Choose the best fit)

### AIDA (Awareness → Interest → Desire → Action)
- Hook with relevance
- Build interest with value
- Create desire with proof/benefit
- Clear CTA

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
- Identify their problem
- Make it feel urgent
- Position as the solution

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
- Their current state (problem)
- Their ideal state (outcome)
- How you bridge the gap

## Hard Rules

1. **50-125 words** - Shorter emails get more replies
2. **Subject line**: 3-5 words, lowercase, no clickbait
3. **First line**: Personalized - reference something specific about them
4. **No fluff**: Cut "I hope this email finds you well", "My name is...", "I wanted to reach out"
5. **One CTA**: Single, specific ask (not "let me know if you're interested")
6. **Read time**: Under 30 seconds
7. **Mobile-friendly**: Short paragraphs, no walls of text

## What Makes It Human

- Sounds like a real person, not a template
- Has a specific reason for emailing THIS person
- Shows you did research
- Doesn't oversell or use hype words
- Has a clear "what's in it for them"

## Output Format

```
Subject: [subject line]

[Email body]

[First name only]
```

**Framework used:** [which one and why]
**Personalization:** [what angle you used]
**Word count:** [number]
